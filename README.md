# Automate-Note

## Description

I tutor kids. And in fact I write more than 3 tutor notes everyweek. Though it does not sound like much, formatting the notes actually takes time, and the time can go pretty high once you accumulate it to one year, two years, etc.
Automate-Note is a project designed to simplify the process of taking, organizing, and formating notes. It offers a web-app interface that allows users to quickly jot down notes, copy them, and directly share them in FORMATTED forms.



## Features

- **Quick Note Taking**: Type your notes on the go without the need to open any specific applications.
- **Note Organization**: Categorize your notes by titles.
- **Search Functionality**: Easily find your notes using dates and other tags.
- **Export Options**: Export your notes to various formats like PDF, Markdown, etc.


## Currently Builidng

- **History Saving**: You can save all your history notes and be able to access them later in the future
- **Note Organization**: Categorize your notes by tags and dates
- **Add a gif to READme**

## Future Goals

- **Set your own note format**: You can create your own note format and change them based on your need instead of using the current note title format
- **Export Option**: Instead of clipboard, you can also export your notes to various formats like PDF, Markdown, etc.
